### I wrote this guide to show you how to setup and run the app locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So this can take a little time to install the packages. Or you can try the [online version](https://codesandbox.io/s/modal-dt7wh)
To run the app, just following these few steps:

- After you've cloned the source, open commandline/terminal and type `npm i`, make sure you're installed nodejs
- Then, just type `npm start` to start the app
